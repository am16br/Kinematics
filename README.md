# Kinematics
Study of movement and forces as waves with animations

Study to visualize how 'information' moves across space through time with interactions between multiple bodies, including orbital trajectories and the double slit experiment.
May generate toolbox of known physical properties (e.g. gravity, average travel velocity) and leverage computer's processing speed (near lightspeed) to consider a higher bandwidth of unknowns.

1. 3-D Kinematics Animation: includes orbital motion, normal and tangential acceleration [kinematics_visualization.py](kinematics_visualization.py)
2. Double-Slit Experiment: Light's form as a wave and/or particle, one-slit and two-slit experiments, Snell's Law of Refraction, self-organizing maps [interference_simulation.py](double-slit-simulator/interference_simulation.py)
3. Lorenz Attractor simulation: System popularized by "Butterfly Effect" with chaotic solutions, deterministic but unpredictable, software offers Runge-Kutta (RK4) integration for First Order Differential Equation [lorenz_ode_simulation.py](Lorenz/lorenz_ode_simulation.py)
