# Kinematics
Study of movement and forces as waves with animations

Study to visualize how 'information' moves across space through time with interactions between multiple bodies, including orbital trajectories and the double slit experiment.
May generate toolbox of known physical properties (e.g. gravity, average travel velocity) and leverage computer's processing speed (near lightspeed) to consider a higher bandwidth of unknowns.
